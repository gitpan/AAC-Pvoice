AAC::Pvoice README

As of version 0.5, these modules should be able to run on all platforms
supported by Device::ParallelPort. This dependency has to do with AAC::Pvoice::Input, which
needs to be able to poll the parallel port in case it needs to communicate
with the 'Adremo' electrical wheelchair. For this I'm  using
Device::ParallelPort, which has drivers for Linux and Win32.

As of version 0.6 the modules allow you to use your application in
One or Two-button mode. See the documentation of AAC::Pvoice::Input for details.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
