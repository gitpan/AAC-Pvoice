AAC::Pvoice README

Because of the current dependency on Win32::API for AAC::Pvoice::Input,
this module will currently only install on Win32 platforms. This will
most likely change in version 0.5.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install


If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
