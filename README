AAC::Pvoice README

As of version 0.5, these modules should be able to run on Linux and
Win32 platforms. This dependency has to do with AAC::Pvoice::Input, which
needs to be able to poll the parallel port in case it needs to communicate
with the 'Adremo' electrical wheelchair. For this I'm now using
Device::ParallelPort, which has drivers for Linux and Win32.

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install


If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
