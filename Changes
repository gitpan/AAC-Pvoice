Revision history for Perl module AAC::Pvoice

0.1 First version
0.2 0.1 didn't arrive on PAUSE correctly
0.3 minor documentation update in AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap
0.4 correction in AAC::Pvoice::Input to read individual bits
    instead of the whole statusbyte from the parallel port
0.5 AAC::Pvoice::Input now no longer uses Win32::API. Now it uses
    Device::ParallelPort, so it should be able to run on Linux now too.
0.6 AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap now returns a wxNullBitmap if the resize-factor
    is 0 to prevent 'illegal division by zero'
    AAC::Pvoice::EditableRow now has some sensible defaults to prevent
    'Use of uninitialized value' warnings
    AAC::Pvoice::Input can now handle one button input
0.7 AAC::Pvoice::Input
        * now allows keyboard input
        * now allows direct mouseclicks on the buttons
    AAC::Pvoice::Panel
        * now uses a round cornered background and
        * no longer simply sets the background for the normal and
          selected state, but draws a round cornered border around
          the rows and buttons that are selected
        * finally got the screensizing correctly...no more weird
          calculating stuff...
