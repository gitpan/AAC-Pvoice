Revision history for Perl module AAC::Pvoice

0.1 First version
0.2 0.1 didn't arrive on PAUSE correctly
0.3 minor documentation update in AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap
0.4 correction in AAC::Pvoice::Input to read individual bits
    instead of the whole statusbyte from the parallel port
0.5 AAC::Pvoice::Input now no longer uses Win32::API. Now it uses
    Device::ParallelPort, so it should be able to run on Linux now too.
