Revision history for Perl module AAC::Pvoice

0.1 First version

0.2 0.1 didn't arrive on PAUSE correctly

0.3 minor documentation update in AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap

0.4 correction in AAC::Pvoice::Input to read individual bits
    instead of the whole statusbyte from the parallel port

0.5 AAC::Pvoice::Input now no longer uses Win32::API. Now it uses
    Device::ParallelPort, so it should be able to run on Linux now too.

0.6 AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap now returns a wxNullBitmap if the resize-factor
    is 0 to prevent 'illegal division by zero'
    AAC::Pvoice::EditableRow now has some sensible defaults to prevent
    'Use of uninitialized value' warnings
    AAC::Pvoice::Input can now handle one button input

0.7 AAC::Pvoice::Input
        * now allows keyboard input
        * now allows direct mouseclicks on the buttons
    AAC::Pvoice::Panel
        * now uses a round cornered background and
        * no longer simply sets the background for the normal and
          selected state, but draws a round cornered border around
          the rows and buttons that are selected
        * finally got the screensizing correctly...no more weird
          calculating stuff...
    AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap
        * now produces round cornered bitmaps
    AAC::Pvoice::Row
        * no longer uses too large images (screensizing update)
    AAC::Pvoice::EditableRow
        * no longer uses too large images (screensizing update)

0.8 AAC::Pvoice::Input
        * when keystrokes are used, alpha keys are now case-insensitive
    Several bugfixes and therefore needed new methods (for most of you
    probably not that important)

0.9 AAC::Pvoice::Bitmap
        * We now use Image::Magick to create the bitmaps. It's a change to
          the internals, so the methods and their parameters stay the same.
        * Returned images are cached first (using File::Cache). If an image
          has been processed before, it will be retrieved from the cache.
          The cache never expires, but every combination of parameters
          results in a new cached image (and of course the file modificationtime
          of the image is also taken into account.
    AAC::Pvoice::Dialog
        * This is a newly added class. It's a subclass of Wx::Dialog and
          allows you to create dialog boxes, using an AAC::Pvoice::Panel
    AAC::Pvoice
        * This module now provides the AAC::Pvoice::MessageBox function,
          similar to Wx::MessageBox.
